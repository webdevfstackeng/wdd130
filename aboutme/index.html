    <p>Hello everyone!. My name is Kgotla. I am married to my dear wife Lesedi and we have five children. The photo above shows me and her. I enjoy jogging and gardening. I come from Botswana, north of South Africa.</p>  
    <p>I have been a member of the church for a while now. I have seen and heard from a couple of latter-day saints prophets, apostle and many wonderful members of the church. One of the late presidents of the church, Gordon B. Hinckley in his talk titled "The Perpetual Education Fund", taught: "Education is the key to opportunity". I am grateful to President Russell M. Nelson, the living prophet. I serve in the Elders Quorum Presidency in our ward.</p>  
    <p>I work in Information Technology user support. I have chosen to study for a degree in Applied Technolgy to aquire new skills and knowledge in website, and database design and development.</p> 
    <p>I am looking forward to learning and working with you.</p>
